Sorting Algorithms Overview
In computer science, sorting algorithms play a crucial role in organizing elements within a list into a specified order. The most common orders include numerical and lexicographical, with options for ascending or descending arrangements. Efficient sorting is essential for enhancing the performance of various algorithms, such as search and merge algorithms, which rely on input data being in sorted lists. Sorting also aids in canonicalizing data and generating human-readable output.

Formally, any sorting algorithm must meet two primary conditions:

Monotonic Order: The output maintains a consistent order where each element is either no smaller or no larger than the previous element, based on the specified criteria.
Permutation: The output represents a permutation, or reordering, of the original input while retaining all the original elements.
For optimal efficiency, it is recommended to store input data in a data structure that allows random access rather than only sequential access.

This project provides an overview of various sorting algorithms, detailing their Big O notations for worst-case, best-case, and average time complexities.
